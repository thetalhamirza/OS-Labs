# Operating System Labs 💻

Repository for Operating Systems lab exercises and coursework tasks. Each lab folder contains small shell scripts and related files that demonstrate OS concepts like process control, file operations, and basic automation. 🧠🧪

## Structure 📁

- Lab folders: Individual lab tasks grouped by lab number.
- Scripts: Small shell utilities for practicing OS-level operations.
- Sample files: Test inputs and outputs used by the scripts.

## Usage ▶️

Most scripts are written in `bash` and can be run from the lab directory:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

Some scripts may expect arguments or specific files to exist in the same folder.

## Notes 📝

- Keep backups of lab outputs if required by your instructor.
- Feel free to add new lab folders as assignments are released.
